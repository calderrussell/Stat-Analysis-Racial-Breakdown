                        I would like to thank everyone who supported me throughout the process of writing this paper. This project would not have been possible without the guidance and support of my advisors, teachers, friends, and family. I am grateful for their encouragement and feedback, which helped me to improve my work and stay motivated.
                    </p>

                        I would like to specifically thank my advisor, Nathan Whitfield, for his invaluable guidance and support throughout this project. Helping me focus my vision on this project and providing readings and acting as a sounding board that kept me grounded and challenging myself not settling for work that was below my full potential.
