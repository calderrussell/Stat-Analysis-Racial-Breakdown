                        Writing this paper has been a challenging and rewarding experience.
                        It has allowed me to explore a topic that I am passionate about and to develop my research and writing skills.
                        I have learned a lot about the process of conducting research, analyzing data, and presenting my findings in a clear and concise manner. 
                        In the past all of the research I had conducted was largely for school assignments and I had never really done research that was self guided. 
                        This project allowed me to truly lead the direction of my work and improve the methods I have to do research.
                        This project has improved my ability to plan out what I am doing and has helped me learn how to adapt when I am facing issues in getting the results I wanted.
                        I faced major issues in accessing data from other districts which ultimately lead me to switch the overall focus of the thesis.
                        I also faced issues in getting student responses to my survey spending more time than I initially allotted for that portion of the paper.
                        Every time I ran into these issues I had to reconsider what the goal of the paper was: should I abandon this facet? Should I change the question? Should I change the methods? I had to learn how to adapt and make decisions that would allow me to still meet my overall goal of writing a paper.
                        To complete this paper I I read into literature that has been published on similar topics to gain a deeper understanding of the issues at hand and to inform my own analysis.

                        I have overall mixed feelings about the final product. 
                        I expected to have more information and data before starting this paper, so I had high hopes for what I could accomplish. 
                        Given the information and resources that I had access to, I am happy with the final product.
                        This is the most substantial piece of writing that I have done and I am glad to have the chance to write something that branches away from my STEM focus and pushes me to think differently. 
                        As a part of this project I learned a lot about myself as a writer and that I really enjoy getting to mix mathematical analysis with the literature and qualitative data to make a more compelling argument.

                        I would like to improve upon is my ability to manage time. This was a major struggle during this project ensuring that I could balance what I needed to do for this project and among other classes. 
                        If I could change one facet of this piece I would focus on Cambridge from the start because so much time that I put into getting information from other districts feels wasted now that is not the focus of my final thesis.
                        If I had another term to improve and add to this project I would likely try to dig deeper into how middle school education is involved in the systemic barriers in our districts education.
                        Getting to have this wider perspective on how students matriculate into highschool would give me a better understanding of the things that they face.
