                        Writing this paper has been a challenging and rewarding experience.
                        It has allowed me to explore a topic that I am passionate about and to develop my research and writing skills.
                        I have learned a lot about the process of conducting research, analyzing data, and presenting my findings in a clear and concise manner. 
                        In the past all of the research I had conducted was largely for school assignments and I had never really done research that was self guided. 
                        This project allowed me to truly lead the direction of my work and improve the methods I have to do research.
                        This project has improved my ability to plan out what I am doing and has helped me learn how to adapt when I am facing issues in getting the results I wanted.
                        I faced major issues in accessing data from other districts which ultimately lead me to switch the overall focus of the thesis.
                        I also faced issues in getting student responses to my survey spending more time than I initially allotted for that portion of the paper.
                        Every time I ran into these issues I had to reconsider what the goal of the paper was: should I abandon this facet? Should I change the question? Should I change the methods? I had to learn how to adapt and make decisions that would allow me to still meet my overall goal of writing a paper.
                        To complete this paper I I read into literature that has been published on similar topics to gain a deeper understanding of the issues at hand and to inform my own analysis.

                        I have overall mixed feelings about the final product. 
                        I expected to have more information and data before starting this paper, so I had high hopes for what I could accomplish. 
                        Given the information and resources that I had access to, I am happy with the final product.
                        This is the most substantial piece of writing that I have done and I am glad to have the chance to write something that branches away from my STEM focus and pushes me to think differently. 
                        As a part of this project I learned a lot about myself as a writer and that I really enjoy getting to mix mathematical analysis with the literature and qualitative data to make a more compelling argument.

                        I would like to improve upon is my ability to manage time. This was a major struggle during this project ensuring that I could balance what I needed to do for this project and among other classes. 
                        If I could change one facet of this piece I would focus on Cambridge from the start because so much time that I put into getting information from other districts feels wasted now that is not the focus of my final thesis.
                        If I had another term to improve and add to this project I would likely try to dig deeper into how middle school education is involved in the systemic barriers in our districts education.
                        Getting to have this wider perspective on how students matriculate into highschool would give me a better understanding of the things that they face.

                        <b>Purpose and Audience Reflection</b>
                        I am doing this project to try and make change. 
                        I want to make a contribution to understanding the inequities that are present in our district. 
                        I would like to figure out if there are any blatant issues that appear from the information that I gather (quantitive or qualitative). 
                        And if I can see a pattern in what is leading students to have unequal enrollment in certain classes I would like to suggest policy changes that could lead to fixes. 
                        I would like others to hopefully gain a bigger picture of the issues that are present in our district and the scope of any solutions that would need to be implemented. 
                        I think that educators and administrators would be most interested in my project, as it is so closely tied to their line of work. 
                        This will influence me to write in a way that gives teachers and other staff the most information that can be directly applied in the classroom or in decisions that affect the school at large. 
                        I could submit my work to journals or people who would be willing to publish it but this is less of a goal of mine than the end result.

                        <b>Reflection on Presentation</b>
                        I think the talk went pretty well. I initially went into the talk worried about being able to articulate what I had done so far in terms of methods, both social sciences and statistics related, and the goals that I have for this project. Once I started the talk, a lot of these worries went away, and I felt comfortable sharing my work with a supportive and interested audience. 

                        Thoughts on my presentation:
                        I would have liked to refine more information on what I have read, but I could not find a sweet spot of lit-review and plans/past methods during this presentation. If we get to do presentations like thsi again I would like to rehearse more and practice general sentence structures (getting more feedback than I did for this one) I could have been more eloquent and less vague when discussing different sections. I would also like to clarify some of the statistical methods, maybe more so that I can tailor my responses more clearly to someone's background knowledge. 

                        New Ideas and what I gained from this presentation:
                        Some new ideas that I got include reaching out to more community members, both within each district and within all of Massachusetts. I was asked if I considered talking to the parents in any district, and I am going to be honest, I hadn't, so that might be an interesting avenue of questioning. I also had a conversation with Ms. FitzGerald about reaching out to Janet Moses to discuss the idea of sharecropper education and see what insights she has to offer on my project. 
                        I would also like to read some papers specifically on teacher biases and what instructional barriers go into unequal access to higher education.
