                        I initially proposed the idea of a research paper comparing the racial distributions of students in math classes within our school to surrounding schools.
                        I wanted to continue the work that I had begun a year ago in my AP US Gov class for my final project where I analyzed the racial distributions of students in Math classes within our school. I wanted to expand on this by comparing our school to surrounding schools and seeing if there were any patterns or trends that could be identified.
                        Unfortunately, I was not able to obtain the data that I needed to complete this project. I reached out to several schools in the area, but I was not able to get the necessary data. I also tried to find the data online, but I was not able to find anything that was relevant to my research question.

                        So I switched lenses and decided to dive deeper into the data that I had already collected for my AP US Gov project. I wanted to analyze the data more thoroughly and see if there were any patterns or trends.
                        I read relevant research papers and articles on the topic of racial disparities in education and how they relate to math classes. I also looked into the history of racial segregation in schools and how it has impacted the current state of education.

                        Through the process of writing this paper I decided that I wanted it to be accesible by a wider audiance having both a highly anylitical tone with a bredth of informaiton and qualitative data included.
